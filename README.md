# Liveliness-CC-Data-Analysis

This is a data science project that my groupmates and I completed over a span of an academic quarter. We developed and cleaned datasets corresponding to the different attributes (valence, BPM, tempo) of top 50 songs from 2012-present. 
We then repeated this process for US consumer confidence data, and used EDA tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib to discover patterns/correlations between attributes of liveliness and economic data.
We finalized and reported our findings in a full Data Science research report, answering the question whether or not economic propersity affects the top songs in the country at any given time period.
